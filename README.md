The intended purpose of this website is for you to create your own character in D&D 5e.
Right now, this site works as a proof-of-concept for my learning of
Flask. A major limitation of my code is the difficulty to test and
therefore more complex development is not possible.
Future work for this website would be to refactor/rebuild it in Django.

For best results, I suggest registering as the character will be saved.
